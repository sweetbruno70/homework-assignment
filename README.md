UCB First Homework.

This was created to understand the nuances of HTML and the CSS styling associated with it. 
It was also created to fulfill the University of Berkley's Coding Bootcamp Homework.

Collaborators: Xandromus who wrote the starter code (source code), Paola Guerrero who provided some feedback on the html code, and my instructor Samantha Randolph.
